Tkinter is a Python library that can be used to create graphical user interface (GUI) applications. It is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit and is Python's standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS installs of Python. 
Tkinter is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. It is an open source, portable GUI library designed for use in Python scripts. Tkinter relies on the Tk library, which is the GUI library used by Tcl/Tk and Perl. 
Tkinter is one of the most commonly used modules for creating GUI applications in Python as it is simple and easy to work with. It is not the only Gui Programming toolkit for Python, but it is the most commonly used one.
